OMGUW Reader
============

**Description**

OMGUW Reader is an easy way to browse University of Waterloo's favourite blog. OMGUW Reader allows you to view posts in OMG, MC, OH, and ASK sections of the blog, as well as read comments of any post.

This application was my second Android app created to learn more about async API calls within Android and whatnot.

**Usage**

Under `resources\BloggerHelper.java`, add your API key to where it says `public final static String API_KEY = "ADD_ME";`
